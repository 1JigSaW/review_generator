I like their app environment and in general I enjoyed the higher interest rates in Savings. I liked the idea of the Revolut Pro account (focused on freelancers) within the same app and also the <18 for kids. My favorite are the perks. It‚Äôs them and the interest rates that keep me staying with Revolut. I‚Äôm able to use for free VPN, Perplexity to only mention a few.\nHowever I wished the Revolut Pro has some more freedom. I‚Äôm not able to use it for Ideal payments. I also wished Revolut would make it possible to open more than one account with the same currency. At the moment it‚Äôs possible to only open 1 account in ‚Ç¨ and 1 in each other currency. The savings accounts don‚Äôt have their own IBAN either. Their savings acts like a fund."

Maintain the conversational, informal tone, and include natural errors, such as missing articles, incorrect prepositions, and some common conversational phrases like 'you know', 'like', 'honestly'. Use a friendly and personal voice, and make sure the review sounds casual and approachable. Such as:\n"
            f" - Unfinished thoughts: Start a thought and leave it hanging like 'I mean, it's just‚Ä¶ you know?' or 'It's good but like‚Ä¶'\n"
            f" - Repeated punctuation**: Use repeated punctuation, like '!' or '?' multiple times in a row (e.g., 'It‚Äôs amazing!!!', 'I love it???').\n"
            f" - Nonsensical or illogical phrases: Throw in phrases that don‚Äôt quite make sense or are unusual, like 'I totally dig it, you know what I mean?' or 'It‚Äôs so cool, like, really cool... yeah'.\n"
            f" - Grammar mistakes: Introduce subtle grammar mistakes, such as: omitting articles (e.g., 'went to store'), wrong prepositions (e.g., 'in the bus' instead of 'on the bus'), or swapped words (e.g., 'definately' instead of 'definitely').\n"
            f" - Repetition of words: Repeat words unnecessarily for emphasis, like 'I really, really like it' or 'It‚Äôs like super, super good.'\n"
            f" - Overuse of colloquial language: Include excessive use of 'like', 'you know', 'actually', 'well', etc.\n"
            f" - Random spacing and indentations: Add random spaces before or after punctuation or between words. You can also add extra spaces between sentences or paragraphs.\n"
            f" - Line breaks and random sentence splitting: Occasionally break up a sentence into two lines, or start a new line halfway through a sentence to mimic casual writing habits.\n"
            f" - Include incomplete sentences or unfinished thoughts: People sometimes don‚Äôt finish their sentences or thoughts. For example: 'It‚Äôs good, but... well, not exactly what I thought.'\n"
            f" - Emotional or subjective commentary: Use subjective statements like 'I mean, I totally love it, but like... it could be better' or 'Honestly, it's not bad, but I guess I expected more.'\n"
            f" - Slight illogical jumps: Include transitions that feel random or slightly off-topic, such as 'But then again, you know what I mean?' or 'Honestly, I didn‚Äôt expect that to happen.'\n"
            f" - Break text into new lines for no reason: Randomly break text into a new line or a sentence midway for a more disjointed feel.\n"
